# Pandas Practice
Being a former athlete, I believe in sharpening my skills whenever posibble. Being a programmer, I believe that a little help can go a long way. This repo serves as a place of reference and practice when doing Data Analytics with the Pandas library in Python. I went and found several open source datasets and gave tasks to analyze the data. There are five different categories in this repo: Introduction to Data, Data Exploration, Data Visualization, Filtering and Sorting, Grouping and Aggregation.

When doing any data work, I like to write comments on what I am doing and my thought process behind why I choose to use diferent things. This helps when looking back at this for a reference when working on a different project. This repo will likely be updated with new sets to show different ways of working with several datasets 

All of the analyzing takes place in Jupyter Notebooks as it is easier to translate the data there

### Categories and Sets

1. Introduction to Data:
  This set gives you a look at the capabilities of Pandas showing how to read, iterrate, locate, sort, modify and save the data

3. Data Exploration
  The set(s) in this category is/are:
  Iris Dataset:
    1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
    2. Display the first 5 rows of the dataset.
    3. Check for missing values in the dataset.
    4. Calculate and display basic summary statistics (mean, median, std, etc.) for each numeric column.
    5. Display unique values in the "Species" column.

4. Data Visualization
  The set(s) in this category is/are:
  Advertising Dataset:
    1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
    2. Create a scatter plot of "TV" advertising expenditure against "Sales."
    3. Plot a bar chart showing the average "Sales" for each "Radio" advertising level.
    4. Visualize the distribution of "Newspaper" advertising expenditure using a histogram.
    5. Create a pair plot to explore relationships between different advertising channels and "Sales."
  
5. Filtering and Sorting
  The set(s) in this category is/are:
  Titanic Dataset:
    1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
    2. Display the number of passengers in each class (Pclass).
    3. Filter and display only the passengers who survived.
    4. Find the average age of passengers.
    5. Sort the DataFrame based on the "Fare" column in descending order.
   
6. Grouping and Aggregation
  The set(s) in this category is/are:
  Wine Reviews:
    1. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
    2. Display the first 5 rows of the dataset.
    3. Group the data by "country" and calculate the average wine price for each country.
    4. Find the maximum and minimum wine prices for each country.
    5. Calculate the total number of wines reviewed for each country.
    6. Display the top 3 countries with the highest average wine prices.
